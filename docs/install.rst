Get Finance Scraper
======================

There are a couple of ways that you can use to install Finance Scraper for your
own usage. They can basically be divided by what you plan on doing with the
project.

Get it for usage in your project
------------------------------
If you simply want to use the Finance Scraper in your own project to fetch
financial data you can simply use the version provided by pip. 

.. code-block:: Terminfo

  pip install FinanceScraper

Afterwards you can import it like you would with any other python module.

.. code-block:: Python

  import financescraper


This is going to be the most recent stable version of the Finance Scraper API.
It is **recommended to use this** if you just want to use the API, as it is the
easiest and safest way to get the project.

Get it for adaption within your project
---------------------------------
If you like the basic capabilities of this API, but are missing that one very
specific thing that you need for usage in your own project, you should think
about cloning the repository containing this project.

.. code-block:: Terminfo

  git clone https://github.com/LukasBudach/Finance Scraper.git

This way you can make your adaptions to the API and use your local version for
your own project. If your project is growing bigger and you need to distribute
your own version of Finance Scraper you might want to consider to *fork* the 
project on GitHub.

Get it to contribute
--------------------
If you can think of changes that could/should be made to this project you are
more than welcome to contribute! If you can improve the functionality or the 
way the user interacts with this API I would be more than happy to take your
suggestions via *Issue on GitHub*. Going even further you can also *fork* this
project on GitHub and put in a pull-request with your changes to get them on
the main project and distributed via pip.

If you want your contributions to be merged into the main projects master
please make sure to meet the coding standards (TODO: Add coding standards to
project documentation) as well as keep the branch to be merged up-to-date with
the Finance Scraper master. *I will not be resolving your merge confilct, but
will reject pull-requests that result in such!*

**The more people use and contribute to this project, the better it gets, so 
just go fir it if you see room to improve! Tell me about it or just do it
yourself and contribute to an awesome finance API!**
