Make a Ticker request
---------------------

This is the main reason you are probably going to want to use this API for your
own project. Finance Scraper is aimimg to provide multiple classes, one for
access to a single of its own data sources. As of Version 0.1.0 there is only
one source - yahoo finance.

Due to this architecture you are going to need to get yourself a scraper object
to make your requests. This object will internally keep a Session_ open, so for
request efficiency it is recommended to keep your scraper object as long as you
are planning to make requests to a specific source.

Here is an example of how you would create the YahooScraper object and use it to
fetch data for a specific ticker:

.. code-block:: Python

  from financescraper import scraper
  yahoo_scraper = scraper.YahooScraper()
  data = yahoo_scraper.get_data('AMZN')

The *get_data(ticker)* method will return a dictionary if the data could be
recovered for the ticker and **None** if not. The dictionary contains the
following:

+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Key             | Value                                                           |
+=================+=================================================================+
| Currency        | Currency code representing the currency of ticker's price (e.g. |
|                 | USD, EUR)                                                       |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| ETF             | Boolean indicating if the ticker belongs to an ETF_             |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Price           | Price of one share of the holding represented by the ticker     |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Security Name   | Name of the holding represented by the ticker                   |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Source          | String representation of the data source (e.g. Yahoo)           |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

If you want to additionally get some more information on the holding/company
behind your ticker, you can do so by fetching the company data like so:

.. code-block:: Python

  from financescraper import scraper
  yahoo_scraper = scraper.YahooScraper()
  data = yahoo_scraper.get_company_data('AMZN')

The *get_company_data(ticker)* method will return a dictionary if the data
could be recovered for the ticker and **None** if not. The dictionary contains
the following:

+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Key             | Value                                                           |
+=================+=================================================================+
| Company Name    | Name of the company represented by the ticker                   |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Description     | Description of the company provided by the data source          |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Exchange        | Name of the exchange the ticker gets traded on (e.g. NasdaqGS)  |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Industry        | Industry the company is active in (e.g. Specialty Retail)       |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Sector          | Sector the company is associated with (e.g. Consumer Cyclical)  |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Symbol          | The ticker symbol                                               |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Website         | Company website as provided by the data source                  |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

Convert between currencies
--------------------------

As this is closely related to the issue of fetching financial data from
international markets, Finance Scraper does also provide a way to convert in
between currencies using the current exchange rates as provided on yahoo
finance.

In order to use this feature you will have to know the currency codes (EUR for
â‚¬, USD for $, CAD for $ and so on) for both your current currency and your
desired currency. If you know this you can create yourself a CurrencyConverter
object and initialize it with your desired currency.

As with the YahooScraper you are going to want to keep your Converter object
as long as you need it, because it does use the YahooScraper internally which
keeps a Session_ open for improved performance.

Here is an example of how you would create the CurrencyConverter object to
convert some currency to USD and how you can then use it to get your prices
converted:

.. code-block:: Python

  from financescraper import conversions
  usd_converter = conversions.CurrencyConverter('USD')
  amount_in_usd = usd_converter.convert('EUR', 100))

If you want to see more code examples please take a look at the bin folder on
this projects repository_.
