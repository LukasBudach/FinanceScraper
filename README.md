# Yahoo Finance Scaper
This project seeks to provide an up-to-date data scraper for yahoo finance as a simple stock data API.

If you are looking for an API that is free and simply works for fetching your ticker's quotes from yahoo finance 
you can use this project! It may not be as fast as other APIs, but a lot of those either require you to pick an
expansive plan or harshly limit the requests you cam make per minute/day.

Another issue of most APIs provided as paid data sources is the availability of international stock data, as most
are simply focussing on the American stock market.
